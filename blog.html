          <h3>Personal Information</h3>
          <p>
            Hello everyone! My name is Serhii Pidhorodetskyi,
            I am 17 years old and currently living in the Swiss
            city of Winterthur.

          <h3>My Hobbies</h3>
          <p>
            One of my greatest passions is chess. I started playing in childhood, 
            inspired by my grandfather, who was also a chess player. I enjoy how 
            chess strengthens my logical thinking and decision-making skills.
            I currently attend a chess club, where I can continue improving 
            and share my interest with others.
          </p>
          <p>
            In addition to chess, I love spending time outdoors in nature and
            staying active through sports. For a long time, I regularly went to
            the gym; however, at the moment, I have less time for it due to
            other commitments.

          <h3>Moving to Switzerland</h3>
          <p>
            My move to Switzerland went quite smoothly, as I had already been
            studying German in my home country. After arriving, I practiced the
            language daily through conversations and significantly improved my
            skills. I also made many new friends who share my interests and
            hobbies.
          </p>
          <p>
            One of them is my friend Pavel, who has already completed his
            Lehrstelle as a programmer and is currently studying and working at
            Roche.

          <h3>Why I Love Switzerland</h3>
          <p>
            I have truly fallen in love with Switzerland â€” for its breathtaking
            nature, peaceful atmosphere, and the kindness of its people. I have
            visited many Swiss cities, and I am always impressed by the country's 
            beauty and charm.
          </p>
          <p>
            I also deeply respect Swiss holidays and traditions, which have
            become an important part of my life. Switzerland has truly become my
            second home.

          <h3>My Dreams and Goals</h3>
          <p>
            From a young age, I developed a strong passion for programming. My
            favorite school subjects were computer science and mathematics, and
            it was clear to me early on that I wanted to build my future in the
            world of technology.
          </p>
          <p>
            I have completed courses in Python and already have practical
            experience with the language. Additionally, I am currently learning
            HTML and CSS. At the moment, I am actively searching for an
            apprenticeship (Lehrstelle) as a programmer.
          </p>
          <p>
            My long-term goal is to become a professional developer and, one
            day, a Senior Developer. I am highly motivated, a quick learner,
            skilled at problem-solving, and I thrive when working
            collaboratively in a team environment.
